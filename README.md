### Example of dynamic programming

The following are some algorithms that implement the dynamic programming technique (memoization and tabulation).

- bestsum.rs: Given an array of numbers and a target sum, return the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the target sum. Memoization and tabulation implementations.

- cansum.rs: Given an array of numbers and a target sum, return true if any combination of numbers in the array can add up to exactly the target sum.

- countconstruct.rs: Given a target string and an array of strings, return the number of ways that the target can be constructed by concatenating elements of the array.

- gridtraveler.rs: Given a grid of size m \* n, return the number of ways you can travel from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid. Memoization and tabulation implementations.

- howcansum.rs: Given an array of numbers and a target sum, return an array containing any combination of elements that add up to exactly the target sum. Memoization and tabulation implementations.

- allconstruct.rs: Given a target string and an array of strings, return a 2D array containing all of the ways that the target can be constructed by concatenating elements of the array.

- fibonacci.rs: Given a number n, return the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence using tabulation.

All of them implement memoization in order to improve the performance of the algorithms.

## How to execute test
